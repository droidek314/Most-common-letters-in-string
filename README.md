# Most-common-letters-in-string
###### My small program to count the most three common letters in user-inputed string. 
My first small project, which was inspired by my friend's internship tasks. There is a lot of unefficient code, from which your head will explode, but I promise that it works.
For now I don't really know how to improve this thing, but eventually, if I will remember about this repository, I may change it. Maybe not.

If you, somehow, managed to find this thing - you are free to make use of it, or rewrite it for better understanding, better algorithm, better time to execute.
